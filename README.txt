Alchemy:
The rules are fire + water = steam, steam + air = cloud, earth + air = dust
Adding new rules is extremely easy: adding to the json var in the CombiningSystem

Each food adds 3 segments to the snake
Each food rots in 10 seconds after generation(rotten food is shown by concentric squares)
Rotten food shrinks 3 segments and also decreases the score
