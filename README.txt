Alchemy:
The rules are fire + water = steam, steam + air = cloud, earth + air = dust
Adding new rules is extremely easy: adding to the json var in the CombiningSystem

Snake:
Each food adds 3 segments to the snake
Each food rots in 10 seconds after generation(rotten food is shown by concentric squares)
Rotten food shrinks 3 segments and also decreases the score

Asteroids:
Arrow keys to move, space to fire
Every 5 asteroid hits takes you to the next level
Large(green) asteroids break into medium ones; medium(purple) asteroids break into smaller ones

Multiplayer Snake:
2 snakes: Green and Pink
Control Green by Arrow Keys, Pink by WASD
Both players try to beat the high score, a snake wins if the other snake goes out of bounds or collides with anyone's body
